# Fifa21_Dirty_Data_Cleaning

## Introduction
   ### Dirty data, or unclean data, is data that is in some way faulty: it might contain duplicates, or be outdated, insecure, incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent. Examples of dirty data include misspelled addresses, missing field values, outdated phone numbers, and duplicate customer records.
   ### According to Tableau, Data cleaning is the process that removes data that does not belong in your dataset. Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another. Transformation processes can also be referred to as data wrangling, or data munging, transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format for warehousing and analyzing. This article focuses on the processes of cleaning that data.
   
## About Data
   ### The data set was gotten from Kaggle and it has 18,979 rows and 77 columns. It contains data of players Id, photoUrl, playerUrl, name, rating, their age, their nationality, the position that they play, their potentials for growth in game and so on.
## Data Claning Process
   ### I used the Microsoft Power BI for this data cleaning, First i imported the data as a CSV file and hit the transform button which brings up the Power Query. All unwanted filles were deleted, i checked for duplicated column and empty column and had them deleted. I renamed the columns that had abbreviated names.
